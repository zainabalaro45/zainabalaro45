It took me eighteen year to realize what an extra-ordinary influence; 
my mother has done on me. She’s kind of person that has thoughtful  decision about 
which line of work I want and ensure I become first among my mate. 
My personal achievement will not have come to reality if not been trained by my mother such a great model of my time.
At a tender age I became a scholar not in my school alone but everywhere in my community. 
I not only love the excitement of simply knowing something new but I also come to understand the idea of given back to 
the community in exchange for new sense of life.
When I was at my teenage that is, when I was in jss3 I was taking teaching my junior and even 
my mate that was the greatest thing that have ever happen to me during my teenage apart from the fact 
that I was the best student when I was still young, that make always thank God always about my life. 
Till date I’m still teaching and impacting knowledge in people that is my greatest achievement till date.
In conclusion, all this great dream will not have come if not for the spirit
 of my great legend mother that back me up.
